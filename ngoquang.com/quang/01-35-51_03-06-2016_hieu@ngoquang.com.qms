Subject: [IT English club] Questions about registration
Hi Quang.

I saw new notice about registering new member of IT English club on Facebook. I have some questions about this. Hope you can help me.

1. What are the requirements to become a member?
2. How many rounds I need to pass to become a member?
3. How much is the fee for this club?
4. What is the time of weekly meeting?

Hope to hear from you soon.

Hieu Tran
